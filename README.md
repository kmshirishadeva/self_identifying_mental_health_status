# self_identifying_mental_health_status
Considering the increasing burden of the mental disorders (as evidenced in National
 Mental Health Survey-2016), it is important to identify the people at the risk of developing
 mental disorder at early stage to take the necessary action.
 Primary Health Care centre is a gate-keeper of the Indian public health care delivery system
 and also an opportunity to screen patient for the risk of developing mental disorders. There
 are some validated tools are available for screen of the person for risk of developing
 psychiatric disorders, however, ready availability, taking response from patients,
 interpretation and quick guide for taking action based on the interpretation of the tool score
 is still challenge for effective and efficient utilization of the screening tool. Expected Output:
 Mobile application for screening of mental health. Users: Public as well as Frontline Health
 worker.
 Our idea is to develop a website which can further be deployed as an application.
 The website first analyzes the mental state of the user by conducting a video questioner.
 The mental state of the user is classified into 4 major categories of ilness. (Mood Disorder, Anxiety
 Disorder, Eating Disorder, Trauma)
 Based on the analysis the user gets 3 different types of support.
 Support through simple games - This can manipulate them from being ill/sick.
 Support through exercises - Helps them to have mental stability.
 Support through communities - The therapists in the communities interacts with the users and
 guides them to feel better and get strong support.
 The users will undergo weekly tests/activities which helps them to track the improvement of
 their being.
The first test uses few situational videos and prompts a multi- choice question to the user, out  of which, the user need to select as per how they would react to the situation being described  in the video.  The second test is to check the status of their mental health throughout the week which will be  asked to describe using emojis.
Through the tests, the result will be generated, later if the user wishes, they can join the
 community which adheres to the user's mental health disorder.
 The website also holds games and exercises— that include coping and mediation techniques—
 which are accessible for users who aren't interested in joining the community. The community
 holds conversation with professional therapists(Each therapist handle 60 users of a community)
 and peers.
 The user will get to take weekly tests to gain clear assessment of their mental health and also
 track the improvement of the user's mental health.
